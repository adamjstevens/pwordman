# pwordman

This is a barebones password manager that stores and generates passwords securely.

The motivation behind pwordman was to create a cyber--security-related tool that 
actually provides utility that a large number of people would benefit from (not 
that this exact password manager is that user friendly). Additionally, this was 
a personal project to showcase my skills, even though the code is far from perfect.
